## âœ¨ Key Features
``` c
//  Interactive Virtual Pet: Choose a companion (dog, cat, or eagle) whose mood, health, and animations reflect your daily progress.
    Gamified Progression: Earn XP for completing habits, level up your buddy, and maintain streaks to unlock rewards and cosmetic customizations.
    AI-Powered Motivation: Your buddy provides dynamic, AI-generated encouragement, personalized insights based on your progress, and SMART goal suggestions to help you succeed.
    Comprehensive Wellness Tracking: Monitor detailed health stats including hydration, physical activity, mental wellness, gut health, and sleep quality.
    Advanced Habit Management: Track both positive habits to build and negative habits to avoid, with unique reward and penalty systems.
    Optional Medication Tracker: An integrated module to help you stay consistent with daily medication, featuring its own streak counter and urgent reminders.
    Detailed Analytics: Visualize your journey with charts for streak progression, habit categories, and sleep patterns. Export your data to CSV or your schedule to a calendar file.

## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration
``` c
// People with neurodivergence (e.g., ADHD, autism) or chronic health needs often face unique barriers to habit formation â€” like executive dysfunction, forgetfulness, or lack of motivation. Existing tools often donâ€™t meet their needs. By tying habit success to the well-being of a virtual companion, BetterBuddy creates a sense of responsibility and positive reinforcement â€” similar to caring for a pet or character in a game.

When users show up for their habits, their buddy thrives â€” making progress feel immediate and emotionally satisfying.
With a built-in medication tracker tied into gamified habit loops, BetterBuddy provides a gentle, fun, and effective way to support consistency in daily care routines.

## ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements
``` c
// *   **Full Backend Integration:** Replace `localStorage` with a proper backend service (e.g., Firebase, Supabase) to enable secure user authentication, data persistence across devices, and cloud storage.
*   **Community & Social Features:** Implement the "Community" feature, allowing users to add friends, share progress, join groups for accountability, or compete on leaderboards.
*   **Deeper Gamification:**
    *   Introduce an in-app currency earned by completing habits, which can be spent in a "shop" for new customizations or one-time use items (e.g., "Health Potion").
    *   Add an achievement system with badges for reaching specific milestones (e.g., "30-Day Streak," "Master of Hydration").
*   **Real-World API Integrations:**
    *   Connect to a live weather API (like OpenWeatherMap) for more dynamic and relevant compulsory habits.
    *   Integrate with health services like Google Fit or Apple Health to automatically import data for physical activity, sleep, or water intake.
*   **Enhanced Notifications:** Implement true push notifications using a service worker to send reminders even when the application is not open in the browser.
*   **Advanced Customization:** Allow users more control over their buddy's appearance (e.g., color changes) and the ability to customize the dashboard layout.
*   **Expanded AI Capabilities:**
    *   Develop a conversational interface to allow users to "chat" with their buddy for motivation.
    *   Enable the AI to proactively suggest new habits based on user patterns and goals.
